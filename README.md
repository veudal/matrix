# Get started

## Prebuilt

Download the `matrix` file, `cd` to your downloads folder and execute:
```
chmod +x matrix && ./matrix
```
in order to give the file execution permissions and run it.

## Compile

The source code is available under `matrix.c` and can be compiled with `gcc matrix.c -o matrix`, then run with `./matrix`.

# Arguments
